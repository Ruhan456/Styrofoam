            <h2><Strong><u>Pros</u></Strong></h2>
            <p>The only major pro of styrofoam is that it is cheap and an easy one use item of consumers.<p>

            <h2><br><Strong><u>Cons</u></Strong></h2>
            
            <h1><u>Decomposition</u></h1>
            <p>Although styrofoam does have methods of being recycled it is common for companies to not use these methods since the 
                few that have operate at a loss. Recycling styrofoam is very difficult because once they have been used for foods and 
                drinks it makes it close to impossible to clean and reuse the materials. This is why most local agencies will require 
                that users throw styrofoam in the garbage rather than recycle it since it is too costly for the company. 
                Photodegradation is the main mode of decomposition, this is because styrofoam is sensitive to sunlight. Over years
                 of continuous exposure, the outer layers of the plastic will eventually turn into a powdery substance. In addition to 
                 this, there is something called leaching, this is when the polystyrene is warmed tiny amounts of styrene can seep out and 
                 contaminate anything in the package.</p>

                 <br>
            <h1><u>Enviornmental risks</u></h1>
            <p> Polystyrene is a nonbiodegradable plastic meaning when thrown away it will remain in the environment 
                for thousands of years. It has been found in waters and winds and is very harmful to animal life because 
                small pieces can obstruct their airflow. Every styrofoam cup produces about 0.07229 pounds of CO2  when 
                scaled up to a larger scale can be a great cause of global warming.</p>

                <br>
            <h1><u>Health Risks</u></h1>
            <p>There are also a lot of health concerns 
                including irritation, nervous system impairments, hormone disruption, and cancer risk . The main cause of these
                 symptoms is that the food and drinks may be contaminated by the styrofoam, this is because of leaching. In 1991, 
                 the Agricultural Experiment Station reported that they spotted styrene monomers in eggshells after being stored in 
                 polystyrene containers. There was also a discovery made of styrofoam cups losing weight while being used meaning
                  styrene is being ingested by consumers.</p>
