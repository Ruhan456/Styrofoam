           <h5>An effective and realistic approach to resolve this problem, first in cities and then hopefully expanding country-wide, is to use alternatives to strive towards eliminating the use of styrofoam in the tableware industry.
             Two great alternatives that have 
            very similar properties are Bagasse and Molded fibers</h5>
            <h3><br><Strong><u>What are they?</u></Strong></h3>
            <h2><Strong><u>Bagasse</u></Strong></h2>
            <h4>Bagasse is the byproduct after extracting the juiced from sugarcane <br> 100% biodegradable and recyclable</h4>
            <h2><Strong><u>Molded Fibers</u></Strong></h2>
            <h4>Molded fiber is made from recycled paperboard or newsprint <br>100% biodegradable and recyclable</h4>
            <br>
            <h3><Strong><u>Why we chose these?</u></Strong></h3>
            <h4>They are both 100% biodegradable and recyclable and can be used for many of the same uses</h4>
            <h6> as styrofoam
                 such as plates, cups, and even packaging. Both have gained a lot of popularity in recent years due to 
                 their eco-friendly nature. Both of these options will be safer and healthier for the environment, animal 
                 life, and human consumers. They both also require less energy to produce lessening their carbon footprint.</h6>
