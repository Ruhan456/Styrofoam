        <h3>We are a new small non-profit organization trying to spread awareness of the harms of styrofoam, and how we as a community of 
          Brampton can start to make the change that is much needed for Canada.</h3>

          <h4>Right now unfortunately we are still starting up and have a very little funding and following, if you are a passionate individual 
            who would like to help fight for our cause please get into contact with our founder (<a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>). Currently, we
            are looking for more funding to help improve the quality of our advertisements and websites to reach more retail business around Canada. If you are
             willing to help us you can find our GoFundMe here (<a href="contact.html">Contact</a>).  Because in the end, what's a little more money spent
             going to do other than help our planet?</h4>

             <h4>Above is a Bar graph depicting what we will be planing to spend the budget on. As we are an eco-friendly organization we opted 
              to using more online advertisements rather than the traditional infographics and fliers. We would also like to help newer manufacturers
               of bagasse and molded fibers start up, so we are deciding we would invest in their companies as well. Other sources of marketing would
                include petitions attending conference for bigger corporations and much more.</h4>
